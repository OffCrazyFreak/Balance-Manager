# Balance-Manager
This is a program created for you to easily keep track of your current balance and compare it to any other times you have inputed your balance.

To run, go to releases, download the desired version, open the .exe file and you are good to go!

If you wish so, you can edit the records outside the program, but I don't recommend that.
The records file is located in "Records" map in "Records.txt" form.
Records are compatible on all three versions.
